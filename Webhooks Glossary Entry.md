### Webhooks

**[Webhooks](https://docs.buttondown.email/api-reference/events-and-webhooks) are useful tools that can automate workflows between two or more apps. When a webhook is triggered by a specific event in one app, it will automatically complete an action in another app.**

The sky’s the limit when it comes to using webhooks to automate Buttondown workflows. Whether you’re looking to sync your subscribers or contents with Notion, grow your subscriber base through [Linktree](https://docs.buttondown.email/integrations/linktree), or create a community for your subscribers on Slack, webhooks are an incredibly useful way to connect Buttondown with your other favorite apps.

  
So, how do you create a webhook? Buttondown integrates seamlessly with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), a paid platform that guides users through the process of generating webhooks.
