# Scheduling a Newsletter

Can Buttondown see the future? Sadly, no. But we do know one thing for certain—that your scheduled newsletters will be sent at the exact date and time that you wish. Read on to learn more about how you can schedule and send your newsletter.

## Getting Started

To set your newsletter in motion, you’ll need:

-   A newsletter [draft](https://docs.buttondown.email/getting-started/registration-and-setup#draft-your-first-newsletter) that’s reviewed and ready to go
    
-   A [subscriber base](https://docs.buttondown.email/getting-started/building-your-subscriber-base) that’s excited for new content (Need to import your subscribers? Our “[Registration & Setup](https://docs.buttondown.email/getting-started/registration-and-setup#import-your-subscribers)” page will walk you through it.)

That’s it! We’re ready to go.

Choose as many tags as you’d like! Your newsletter will go out to any and all subscribers with the selected tags.

Fun Fact: Even if you schedule your newsletter to send days or weeks later, that newsletter will also go out to any new subscribers who sign up (and are given the appropriate tags) between now and then.

### Set your target date and time

Buttondown can schedule your newsletter to send whenever you like—as long as it’s in the future. To set a specific date and time, click the “Scheduling” button at the bottom of your newsletter draft. Fill in your target date and time, and double check that your time zone is correct before clicking “Save.”

You’re almost there! Only one more step, which is…

### Don't forget to click send

Make sure you click “Send” in the bottom right corner before exiting your draft. Don’t worry—your newsletter won’t actually send until the date and time you specified in the “Scheduling” pop-up.

You’ll see a congratulatory pop-up with buttons to share your newsletter via social media or a copy-and-paste-able URL. And, in case of emergency, you’ll also have an option to “Undo” sending your newsletter.

### Sit back and relax

You did it! Now you won’t even need to see the future to know that your newsletter will be sent and published just as you scheduled it.
