# Stripe

Earning money through your newsletter can be fun. Figuring out logistics, less so. But have no fear—[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) integrates seamlessly with Buttondown to help you collect payments and report taxes related to your paid newsletter. 

## Getting Started

Here’s what you’ll need to set up your Stripe account:

-   A [paid](https://buttondown.email/pricing) Buttondown account—visit our [pricing](https://buttondown.email/pricing) page for a detailed breakdown of our subscription tiers!

-   Personal information including your name, address, and last four digits of your social security number
    
-   Business contact information including you address and contact number for customer service
    
-   Bank information including your account number and routing number

## Integrating Buttondown with Stripe

### Set up your Stripe account through Buttondown

We built a shortcut to sign up for Stripe in the "Paid Subscription" section of your Buttondown settings.

Once you verify your Buttondown email address and phone number, you’ll be guided through a series of questions to activate payments to your new Stripe account. Stripe will ask for various personal, business, and bank information including the last four digits of your social security number, your business address, and your account and routing numbers. For a step-by-step guide on completing this activation process, check out Stripe’s doc on how to “[Activate Your Account](https://stripe.com/docs/account/activate).”

### Add your preferred payment methods

From credit cards to virtual wallets to bank debits and beyond, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) works with dozens of different payment methods. You can select as many payment methods as your heart desires by navigating to the “Payment Methods” page from your “Product Settings.” Here’s a glimpse of what this page will look like:

Once you’re satisfied with your choices, go to the “Payments” button in your dashboard to create a new payment link. For simplicity’s sake, let’s use Stripe’s no-code checkout page.

First, make sure that your checkout “Type” is set to “Products or Subscriptions.” Then add a new “Product” by filling in the name, description, price, and billing period for your newsletter.

When you’re ready, go ahead and publish your link. You’ll be directed to an overview page where you can copy your payment link as a URL, send it as a QR code, or configure it as a “Subscribe” button for your newsletter or website.
