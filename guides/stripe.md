## Integrating Buttondown with Stripe

### Set up your Stripe account through Buttondown

Head to the "Paid Subscriptions" section of your [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/settings) settings. You'll find a built-in shortcut to integrate your Buttondown account with Stripe.

Once you verify your Buttondown email address and phone number, you’ll be guided through a series of questions to activate payments to your new Stripe account. Stripe will then ask for various personal, business, and bank information including the last four digits of your social security number, your business contact information, and your bank account and routing numbers. 

For a step-by-step guide on completing this process, check out Stripe’s doc on how to “[Activate Your Account](https://stripe.com/docs/account/activate).” Once you activate your Stripe account, you'll have the opportunity to manage your paid subscriptions in your Buttondown settings. 

### Add your preferred payment methods

From credit cards to virtual wallets to bank debits and beyond, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) works with dozens of different payment methods. You can select as many payment methods as your heart desires by navigating to the “Payment Methods” page from your “Product Settings.” Here’s a glimpse of what this page will look like:

Once you’re satisfied with your choices, go to the “Payments” button in your dashboard to create a new payment link. For simplicity’s sake, let’s use Stripe’s no-code checkout page.

First, make sure that your checkout “Type” is set to “Products or Subscriptions.” Then add a new “Product” by filling in the name, description, price, and billing period for your newsletter.

When you’re ready, go ahead and publish your link. You’ll be directed to an overview page where you can copy your payment link as a URL, send it as a QR code, or configure it as a “Subscribe” button for your newsletter or website.
